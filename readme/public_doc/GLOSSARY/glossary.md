| Terrarium Farm                     | The Terrarium Farm is a repository containing curated collection of content that enables essential features such as generalization of infrastructure dependency interfaces, taxonomy management and auto-complete suggestions for terraform and app-dependencies. |
| Terrarium Dependency Interface     | The Terrarium Dependency Interface is a contract that defines the inputs and outputs of an infrastructure dependency, facilitating communication between applications and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). |
| Terrarium Platform Framework       | The Terrarium Platform Framework facilitates the creation of reusable Infrastructure as Code configurations using Terraform. Templates built using this framework are referred to as Terrarium Platform templates. |
| Terrarium App Metadata             | Terrarium App metadata provides a way for applications to declare their infrastructure dependencies. |
| CLI                                | Our command-line interface (CLI) offers a seamless experience for working with Terrarium. It includes commands for Terrarium Auto-Complete, leveraging the Terrarium Platform framework, adding dependencies to your applications, and ultimately composing a fully functional Terraform template by combining the Platform template and the app-specific dependencies. |
| VS Code Extension                  | Our VS Code extension is designed to assist DevOps professionals in writing Terraform code and streamlining infrastructure dependency declaration for the app Developers. |
| Web UI            | The UI component, currently in development, will provide comprehensive documentation and visual representations of the Terrarium Platform Templates, the implemented dependencies within the Platform, and platform insights. This will help DevOps professionals gain a clear overview of the platform template and assist developers in selecting appropriate dependencies. |
