# Requirements

The requirements are written in the YAML files and then the generate commands use them to generate the LZ code using platform.

## Format

The requirements YAML files are written using the App Manifest format defiled [here](../../../src/pkg/metadata/app/readme.md)

## Naming Convention

- **requirements/.env.yaml** - This is autogenerated form the environment types chosen in the Makefile
- **requirements/common.yaml** - Specify any specific requirements for the Common Layer code that need to be generated. The Common Layer code gets all the other team's requirements as well so only add components here that is independent of the team requirement.
- **requirements/team-< team name >.yaml** - Requirement of a team that is independent of the envs.
- **requirements/shared-team-< team name >.yaml** - Requirement of a team's shared layer which is not already specified in the team requirements.
- **requirements/env-team-< env name >-< team name >.yaml** - Requirement of a team's specific env layer which is not already specified in the team requirements.

## Mapping of Target directories to the requirement files

Here's how the requirement files are utilized for generating each layer in the landing zone:

1. Common or the Root layer - uses all requirement files
   - requirements/*.yaml
2. Team Shared layer
   - requirements/.env.yaml
   - requirements/team-< team name >.yaml
   - requirements/shared-team-< team name >.yaml
3. Team Env layer
   - requirements/team-< team name >.yaml
   - requirements/env-team-< env name >-< team name >.yaml
