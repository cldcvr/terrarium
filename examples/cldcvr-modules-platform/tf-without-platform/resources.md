This Terraform code is creating a variety of AWS resources, configured to interact with each other in a specific way. The code is organized into modules, each of which is responsible for creating a specific set of resources. The modules are then composed together to create the complete Infrastructure:

### 1. Data Sources:
- `aws_availability_zones`: Fetches a list of all the availability zones in the current AWS region.
- `aws_region`: Fetches the current AWS region.

### 2. Local Values:
- `name`: A constructed string used for naming AWS resources, based on a common prefix and environment variable.
- `region`: The name of the current AWS region.
- `vpc_cidr`: The CIDR block for the VPC, fetched from variables.
- `azs`: A slice of the availability zone names, selecting the first two.
- `tags`: A map of common tags for resources, fetched from variables.

### 3. VPC Module (`module "vpc"`):
- Creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with the specified name, CIDR block, and availability zones.
- Creates both private and public subnets in each of the specified availability zones.
- Configures a NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from the private subnets.

### 4. EC2 Instance Module (`module "ec2_instance"`):
- Creates an EC2 instance with the specified name, AMI, instance type, and key name.
- Enables detailed monitoring.
- Associates the instance with a security group and places it in a subnet created by the VPC module.
- Applies the common tags.

### 5. EC2 Security Group Module (`module "ec2_sg"`):
- Creates a security group for the EC2 instance with specified ingress and egress rules.
- Associates the security group with the VPC created by the VPC module.

### 6. Database Module (`module "aws_sql_database"`):
- Creates an RDS instance with the specified class, username, password, name, engine, and storage settings.
- Associates the RDS instance with a security group and places it in the private subnets created by the VPC module.

### 7. Database Security Group Module (`module "db_sg"`):
- Creates a security group for the RDS instance with specified ingress and egress rules.
- Associates the security group with the VPC created by the VPC module.

### 8. Redis Module (`module "redis"`):
- Creates an ElastiCache Redis cluster with the specified settings.
- Associates the cluster with a security group and places it in the private subnets created by the VPC module.

### 9. Redis Security Group Module (`module "redis_sg"`):
- Creates a security group for the Redis cluster with specified ingress and egress rules.
- Associates the security group with the VPC created by the VPC module.

Throughout the code, various AWS resources are tagged with a common set of tags, and resource configurations are parameterized using variables and local values to make the code more reusable and maintainable.
